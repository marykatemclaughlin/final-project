## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I am, in general, fairly at a loss of what I can do. I am not sure if this idea would be too basic for a final project, but I was thinking of creating a sort of quiz (maybe personality-based, maybe informational) that a user could play and get a result based on their answers.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

N/A

## Do you have any questions of your own?

What would a project look like for someone who is hypothetically behind in some of the lecture material?
