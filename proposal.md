# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Astrology Compatibility Calculator -- Webpage

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that calculates the synastry (or compatibility) of two individual's information that the user will input. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Following the Webpage vidoes by CS50, I will create a viable website that people can access and use. It will be able to take the information that the user inputs (birthday) to classify their astrological sign. The user will input 2 sets of information and the program will then calculate their compatibility based on the combination the user inputs. I'm not sure if I can work with python and HTML, but if not then I will have to learn how to do the calculations through java. The calculations will be on the backend and the user will just see hopefully aesthetically-pleasing input boxes and a compatibility score once they submit the form.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Creating a website that links to all combinations of zoadiac signs and their compatibility.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A website that takes the 2 birthdays that the user inputs and returns a compatibility percentage.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

An aesthetically-looking website, with drop tab menus, for the user to select from. Would direct the user to a separate screen with compatibilty. Would give a blurb with percentage on why/why not the pairing has the compatibility rating, customized to the combination of information entered. Takes into account more than the sun sign (birthday) and considers moon (birth place).

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will follow the CS50x videos to become familiar with the appropriate programming tools and languages (HTML, CSS, Java, etc). I will need to figure out how to create a wesbite, organize texts and inputs on the website, and possibly learn about domains.I will need to research each sun sign and their compatibility with each other.
