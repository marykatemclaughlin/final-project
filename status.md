Learned how to create a website through VS Code, funtioning drop-down menus, learned how to create a form, learned different web styling.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Research compatibility framework (which signs are more/less compatibile). I need to continue to learn more about coding within HTML files, and how to redirect the user to a different site once the form is submitted.

None so far, it's just a learning curve with a heavily restricted time limitation.
